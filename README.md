This project is meant to bootstrap your holiday spirits! üéÑ

In the project directory, you can make santas elves do the following:

## First time (pnpm setup)

After looking at his excel spreadsheets, Santa decided that to be able to deliver his packages in a timely manner this year, he would need to improve his package management systems.

Concluding a long and ardous process it was decided that [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) was a good candidate.

Make the elves take a course in the new system by running
`npm install -g pnpm`

## Development - `pnpm ho-ho`

A strong elve is picked and forced into Rudolfs harness, this enables the process of quick testing and iteration reloading the sled automatically, usually at the cost of just one elf.

`pnpm ho-ho` then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see it in action.

## Production build - `pnpm jingle-bells`

Whip the elves into action, shaving Rudolf for low drag, and remove any packages intended for naughty kids. Optimizing for aerodynamics, they sift through the packages with care, ensuring only the nicest components make it into the final build. The result? A sleek, high-performance drug-enhanced raindeer ready to deliver holiday magic to all the good boys and girls.
