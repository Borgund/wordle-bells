This project is meant to bootstrap your holiday spirits! 🎄

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can make santas elves run:

### `yarn dev`

Forces the elves to start the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The elves reload the page if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console, feel free to ignore any crys for help the elves send here.

### `yarn build`

Makes the elves put on some elbow grease and build the app for production to the `build` folder.\
They correctly bundle React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance at the cost of their freedom.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
